		based on a concept called byte pair encoding (BPE)
	- installed and used Tiktoken lib from openai via github)
	
07/05
	- Bought book using 4th of july sale (needed to access appendix A)
	
07/27
	- Updated python version and tiktoken, updated python -> python3 symbolic link
	- Retested tiktoken, tried out various word->token encodings 
	- Updated shortcut in 'Reference:' section below.
	- Renamed source files to ref section and order they were created
		
08/03 
	- Fixed torch / python language version selection via bbedit and shell profiles		

08/04
	- Added Sec260TestDataLoader.py

=== 2025 ===
02/02

	- Created virtual env w/ torch and tiktoken installed (activate instructions are below) 
	- Updated online book to latest version 

02/28
	- Read Ch 3 up to 3.4.2 Implementing a compact self-attention Python class

03/07

	- Attempted run on win using activate, but enviro seems to be mac/bash only. 

3/20
	- Test connectivity from work 

NEXT: 
-------
	- *** Before starting anything, check working copy status & pull latest from GitHub
	- *** Before starting anything, activate virtual env (mac only for now), see below 

	- Continue at Reference link (below)
		Section 3.4.2 assignment, see "Exercise 3.1 Comparing SelfAttention_v1 and SelfAttention_v2"

NOTE: 
	To activate virtual env on mac use: 
		mazerlodge@TheoVI LLMFromScratch % source ./bin/activate

	To run current code file in VS Code on mac Fn + F5

Dependencies: 
TiToken from Since implementing BPE can be relatively complicated, we will use an existing Python open-source library called tiktoken (https://github.com/openai/tiktoken)
Installed via: 
	pip install tiktoken 

After install can verify by checking version.  See my source code file TestTiToken.py
